	<br>
	<p>Organizations often spend up to 5% of their total operating budget on energy and other utilities. You cannot manage what you do not measure. NRG Tracker provides an easy way to get utility data into a database and perform analytics. Modeling utility usage gives users vital insights into the performance of the buildings they are operating. It also allows for quick audits of utility billing rates, and guards against overcharging from utility providers.
